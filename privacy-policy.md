# Privacy Policy for Moonly

*Last updated: November 23, 2025*

## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

At Moonly, we believe your dreams and personal reflections belong to you. We've built our app with privacy at its core, ensuring your personal information remains private and secure.

## What We DON'T Do

- We DO NOT collect, store, or access your personal dream data on any servers
- We DO NOT upload your dream journals to the cloud
- We DO NOT share or sell your data with third parties
- We DO NOT track your dreams or personal reflections remotely
- We DO NOT use encryption for local storage (all data is stored in standard Hive boxes on your device)

## How Your Data is Stored

### Local Storage Only
All your dream journals, daily entries, and personal insights are stored exclusively on your device using local storage (Hive database). This means:

- Your data never leaves your phone
- Only you can access your dreams and journals through the app
- If you delete the app, all locally stored data is permanently removed
- No backups are made to cloud services
- Data is stored in standard format without encryption

### Authentication Data
We only collect minimal information required for app functionality:
- Email address (for authentication only)
- Subscription status (to enable premium features)
- Basic usage analytics (app crashes, performance metrics)

This data is securely managed through Firebase Authentication and is never linked to your dream or journal content.

## AI Interactions

When you use our AI features for shareable cards:
- Pattern analysis is performed locally on your device
- No dream content is stored on our servers
- AI-generated insights are created based on aggregated patterns only
- Generated cards contain only the insights you choose to share
- Your full dream content remains private and local

## Your Control and Responsibility

- You have complete control over your data
- You may choose to share generated cards or information at your discretion
- We are not responsible for data you choose to share outside the app
- You can request account deletion by filling out our data deletion form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexjThyRZHPMT6fnZrflPsFjMVajGao6PlJrNQUSHcTV1z8rg/viewform
- You can immediately delete all your data by uninstalling the app

## Data Deletion

You can delete your data in two ways:
1. **Immediate deletion**: Uninstall the app from your device
2. **Account deletion**: Submit a request through our data deletion form at https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSexjThyRZHPMT6fnZrflPsFjMVajGao6PlJrNQUSHcTV1z8rg/viewform

Upon receiving your deletion request, we will:
- Remove your authentication data from Firebase
- Cancel any active subscriptions
- Delete any associated account information

Note: Since dream and journal data is stored only on your device, uninstalling the app immediately removes all personal content.

## Third-Party Services

We use the following services with minimal data sharing:
- Firebase Authentication (for login and account management)
- Payment processors (Revenue Cat, Apple App Store and Google Play Store for subscriptions)
- Firebase Analytics (for app performance monitoring)

These services have their own privacy policies and handle only the minimum data required for their functions.

## Children's Privacy

Moonly is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13, please contact us immediately.

## International Users and Compliance
